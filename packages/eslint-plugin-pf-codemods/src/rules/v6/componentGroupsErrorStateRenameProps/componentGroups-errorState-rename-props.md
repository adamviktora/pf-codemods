### componentGroups-errorState-rename-props [(react-component-groups/#145)](https://github.com/patternfly/react-component-groups/pull/145)

In react-component-groups, we've renamed some ErrorState props to comply with its base component - EmptyState.

#### Examples

In:

```jsx
%inputExample%
```

Out:

```jsx
%outputExample%
```
